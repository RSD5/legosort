The GUIs are designed in QT 4 Designer

The GUIs are saved in .ui files, which needs to be converted to python files.
This is done with the pyuic4 commando, like this:

$ pyuic4 OEE.ui -o ../src/OEE.py

Be sure to get the last part pointing to the right file. 
../src/OEE.py is the resulting Python class you should import into the node.

pyuic4 can be sintalled like this: sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools
